Below are listed all columns in the data set. Every listed column is numeric with the exception of the first two columns (subject and activity), which are integers. The subject column has integers that are 1-30 because there were 30 subjects in the study. The activity column has integers that are 1-6 because there were 6 different activities that were tested and are thus each specified by a different integer.

Each column with the suffix of "mean" or "Mean" contains mean values for the measurement specified by the column name prefix.

Each column with the suffix of "std" contains standard deviation values for the measurement specified by the column name prefix.

Further details about the data and the technologies involved in the tests and in the data collection are available in the README.txt file.

Additional information about the data:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
